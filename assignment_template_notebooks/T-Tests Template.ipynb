    "the speech).\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine this possibility, the authors randomly assigned 39 professional recruiters for *Fortune 500*\n",
    "companies to one of two conditions. In the audio condition, participants listened to audio recordings of a\n",
    "job candidate’s spoken job pitch. In the transcript condition, participants read a transcription of the job\n",
    "candidate’s pitch. After hearing or reading the pitch, the participants rated the job candidates on three\n",
    "dimensions: intelligence, competence, and thoughtfulness. These ratings were then averaged to create a\n",
    "single measure of the job candidate’s intellect, with higher scores indicating the recruiters rated the\n",
    "candidates as higher in intellect. The participants also rated their overall impression of the job candidate\n",
    "(a composite of two items measuring positive and negative impressions). Finally, the participants\n",
    "indicated how likely they would be to recommend hiring the job candidate (0 - not at all likely, 10 -\n",
